def make_addition_expressions(N, max_operand_digits=2, seed=123):
    '''Generates arithmetic expressions involving the addition operator and two `max_operand_digits` digit operands.
    By default, each operand is a 2 digits long positive integer, so the largest sum that can be included is 99+99=198.

    Includes the special characters:
    - '.' to indicate the end of an expression has been reached. int code = 12.
    - '#' to pad an expression so that all expressions have the same length in chars. int code = 13.

    This function is provided to you. You should not need to modify it.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    N: int.
        Number of expressions to generate.
    max_operand_digits: int.
